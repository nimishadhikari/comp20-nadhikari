I covered up the entire screen with the map and didn't use any other design
thing.

Also my infowindows don't close until you press the close button. I could make
that better by shifting a single marker rather than creating a host of new markers.
Edit: I changed this to make sure I use only one infowindow now.
I used a stackoverflow page to learn about closures.

I don't know whether it's because the language is asynchronous but I cannot send
my longitude and latitude after geolocation as the request send parameter, so I
think I didn't do that the way I'm supposed to, I just send in a location in
Boston.
Other than that, I feel like most of the work has been correctly implemented.
