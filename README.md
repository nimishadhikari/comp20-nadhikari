README

This Git repository is to stores all my work for the assignments and labs we have in Comp20(Web Programming).
My favorite assignment was Assignment 3, because I enjoyed learning how a website and a server interact, through sending and receiving JSON data.
I have a better understanding and respect for how the web works, and I think I keep in mind the better web programming practices I learn in this class with me.
The most important things I learnt were reading the API documentations, Google Maps for Assignment 2 and Calendar for our group project, because I think that will be applicable to use later on. Another think I learned was how servers interact with databases, and implementing GET and POST requests, in Assignment 3.
I would like to delve deeper into security because for something as ubiquitous as the internet, we do not really care about the security.
