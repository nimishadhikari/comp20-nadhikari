1. The purpose of this Git repository is to store my work for all the assignments and labs we have in comp20.

2. My favorite assignment was Assignment 3, because I enjoyed to see how a server could interact with a product and a database.
   It was like bringing all the things in class together.
3. I have a better understanding and respect for how the web works, and I think I keep in mind the better web programming practices I learn in this class with me.
4. The most important things I learnt were reading the API documentations, Google Maps for Assignment 2 and Calendar for our group project, because I think that will be applicable to use later on. Another think I learned was how servers interact with databases, and implementing GET and POST requests, in Assignment 3.
5. I would like to delve deeper into security because for something as ubiquitous as the internet, we do not really care about the security.
